# MIT 6.100L: Introduction to CS and Programming in Python

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises from MIT's 6.100L course (Fall 2022), which introduces fundamental concepts in computer science and programming using Python. Topics covered include:

- Variables, expressions, and statements
- Control flow (conditionals and loops)
- Functions and recursion
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries, tuples)
- Algorithmic problem-solving
- Debugging and testing
